# Resources

You can set descriptive resources on your character.

`resources <name>` - Lists resources for a character.
`resource/set <title>=<description>` - Sets a resource.
`resource/remove <title>` - Removes a resource.

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' resources:

`resource/remove <name>=<title>`
`resource/set <name>=<title>/<description>`
