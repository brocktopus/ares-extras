# Skills

You can set descriptive skills on your character.

`skills <name>` - Lists skills for a character.
`skill/set <title>=<description>` - Sets a skill.
`skill/remove <title>` - Removes a skill.

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' skills:

`skill/remove <name>=<title>`
`skill/set <name>=<title>/<description>`
